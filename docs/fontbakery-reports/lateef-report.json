The examples in the OpenType spec\n        of non-variable fonts with a STAT table show that the table entries must be\n        restricted to those entries which refer to the static font's position in\n        the designspace. i.e. a Regular weight static should only have the following\n        entry for the weight axis:\n\n        <AxisIndex value=\"0\"/>\n        <Flags value=\"2\"/>  <!-- ElidableAxisValueName -->\n        <ValueNameID value=\"265\"/>  <!-- Regular -->\n        <Value value=\"400.0\"/>\n\n        However, if the STAT table intended for a variable font is compiled into a\n        static, it will have many entries for this axis.
