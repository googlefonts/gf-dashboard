For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also\n        contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports\n        Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also\n        supports the Latn script.\n\n        The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,\n        but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly \"leading\" in the design,\n        while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a\n        Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it\u2019s designed\n        for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers\n        don\u2019t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.\n\n        The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language\n        and script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the\n        locl feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in\n        dlng explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages\n        in meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).\n\n        This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the\n        slng and dlng structures.\n\n        All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the 'meta' table.\n        Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to.\n        The Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for\n        smarter filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added\n        to the Noto fonts.\n\n        In the font making process, some environments store this data in external\n        files already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this\n        inside the font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools\n        may read this data.
