Axes present in a font file but not in this\n        registry will not function via our API. No variable font is expected to\n        support all of the axes here.\n\n        Any font foundry or distributor library that offers variable fonts has a\n        implicit, latent, de-facto axis registry, which can be extracted by scanning\n        the library for axes' tags, labels, and min/def/max values. While in 2016\n        Microsoft originally offered to include more axes in the OpenType 1.8\n        specification (github.com/microsoft/OpenTypeDesignVariationAxisTags), as of\n        August 2020, this effort has stalled. We hope more foundries and distributors\n        will publish documents like this that make their axes explicit, to encourage\n        of adoption of variable fonts throughout the industry, and provide source\n        material for a future update to the OpenType specification's axis registry.\n    ", "result": "SKIP", "severity": null}, {"description": "Does METADATA.pb copyright field contain broken links?", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "SawarabiGothic-Regular.ttf", "key": ["<Section: Metadata Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:googlefonts/metadata/broken_links>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "ok", "message": "All looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "vendorspecific.googlefonts.metadata.broken_links", "proposal": ["https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/2550", "https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/4110"], "rationale": "\n        This check ensures that any URLs found within the copyright\n        field of the METADATA.pb file are valid.\n    ", "result": "PASS", "severity": null}, {"description": "METADATA.pb: Font styles are named canonically?", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "SawarabiGothic-Regular.ttf", "key": ["<Section: Metadata Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:googlefonts/metadata/canonical_style_names>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "ok", "message": "All looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "vendorspecific.googlefonts.metadata.canonical_style_names", "proposal": ["https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/4829"], "rationale": "\n        If the style is set to 'normal' in the METADATA.pb file, we expect a\n        non-italic font - i.e. the font's macStyle bit 1 should be set to 0,\n        and the font's fullname should not end with \"Italic\"; similarly if\n        the style is set to 'italic', we expect a font with the macStyle bit 1\n        set to 1, and the font's fullname ending with \"Italic\".

For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also\n        contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports\n        Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also\n        supports the Latn script.\n\n        The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,\n        but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly \"leading\" in the design,\n        while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a\n        Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it\u2019s designed\n        for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers\n        don\u2019t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.\n\n        The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language\n        and script.
