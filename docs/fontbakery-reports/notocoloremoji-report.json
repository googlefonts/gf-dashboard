For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also\n        contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports\n        Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also\n        supports the Latn script.\n\n        The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,\n        but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly \"leading\" in the design,\n        while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a\n        Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it\u2019s designed\n        for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers\n        don\u2019t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.\n\n        The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language\n        and script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the\n        locl feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in\n        dlng explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages\n        in meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).\n\n        This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the\n        slng and dlng structures.\n\n        All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the 'meta' table.\n        Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to.\n        The Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for\n        smarter filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added\n        to the Noto fonts.\n\n        In the font making process, some environments store this data in external\n        files already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this\n        inside the font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools\n        may read this data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.\n    ", "result": "WARN", "severity": 3}, {"description": "Check small caps glyphs are available.", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "NotoColorEmoji-Regular.ttf", "key": ["<Section: Font File Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/missing_small_caps_glyphs>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "ok", "message": "All looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "googlefonts.glyphset", "proposal": ["https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/3154"], "rationale": "\n        Ensure small caps glyphs are available if\n        a font declares smcp or c2sc OT features.\n    ", "result": "PASS", "severity": null}, {"description": "Are there non-ASCII characters in ASCII-only NAME table entries?", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "NotoColorEmoji-Regular.ttf", "key": ["<Section: Font File Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/name/ascii_only_entries>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "ok", "message": "All looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "googlefonts.name", "proposal": ["legacy:check/074", "https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/1663"], "rationale": "\n        The OpenType spec requires ASCII for the POSTSCRIPT_NAME (nameID 6).\n\n        For COPYRIGHT_NOTICE (nameID 0) ASCII is required because that string should be\n        the same in CFF fonts which also have this requirement in the OpenType spec.\n\n        Note:\n        A common place where we find non-ASCII strings is on name table entries\n        with NameID > 18, which are expressly for localising the ASCII-only IDs\n        into Hindi / Arabic / etc.\n    ", "result": "PASS", "severity": null}, {"description": "Description strings in the name table must not exceed 200 characters.", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "NotoColorEmoji-Regular.ttf", "key": ["<Section: Font File Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/name/description_max_length>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "ok", "message": "All looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "googlefonts.name", "proposal": ["legacy:check/032"], "rationale": "\n        An old FontLab version had a bug which caused it to store copyright notices\n        in nameID 10 entries.\n\n        In order to detect those and distinguish them from actual legitimate usage of\n        this name table entry, we expect that such strings do not exceed a reasonable\n        length of 200 chars.\n\n        Longer strings are likely instances of the FontLab bug.\n    ", "result": "PASS", "severity": null}, {"description": "Make sure family name does not begin with a digit.", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "NotoColorEmoji-Regular.ttf", "key": ["<Section: Font File Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/name/familyname_first_char>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "ok", "message": "All looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "googlefonts.name", "proposal": ["legacy:check/067"], "rationale": "\n        Font family names which start with a numeral are often not discoverable\n        in Windows applications.\n    ", "result": "PASS", "severity": null}, {"description": "Font has all mandatory 'name' table entries?", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "NotoColorEmoji-Regular.ttf", "key": ["<Section: Font File Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/name/mandatory_entries>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "ok", "message": "All looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "googlefonts.name", "proposal": ["legacy:check/156"], "rationale": "\n        We require all fonts to have values for their font family name,\n        font subfamily name, full font name, and postscript name.
