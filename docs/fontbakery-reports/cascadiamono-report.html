        <p>By late-December 2024, FontBakery version 0.13.0 introduced a new naming scheme for the check-IDs.<br><br>Fontbakery detected usage of old IDs and performed an automatic backwards-compatibility translation for you.<br>This automatic translation will be deprecated in the next major release.<br><br>Please start using the new check-IDs as documented at <a href='https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/blob/31970cdc5807c3b75c2f9b6e223aca57ffda535f/Lib/fontbakery/legacy_checkids.py'>/Lib/fontbakery/legacy_checkids.py</a><br><br>The following legacy check-IDs were detected:<br> - com.google.fonts/check/outline_short_segments<br> - com.google.fonts/check/outline_colinear_vectors<br> - com.google.fonts/check/outline_semi_vertical<br> - com.google.fonts/check/version_bump<br> - com.google.fonts/check/fontdata_namecheck<br> - com.google.fonts/check/ttx_roundtrip<br> - com.google.fonts/check/outline_jaggy_segments<br> - com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss<br><br></p>

<p>Meaning of check results:</p>

<ul>
<li>💥 An <em>ERROR</em> is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
<li>☠ A <em>FATAL</em> is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed
immediately.
<li>🔥 A <em>FAIL</em> is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
<li>⚠️ A <em>WARN</em> is something that you should consider addressing.
<li>ℹ️ An <em>INFO</em> result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
<li>✅ A <em>PASS</em> means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
<li>⏩ And a <em>SKIP</em> happens when the check does not apply to the given font.
</ul>

<p>If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at our
    <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues">issue tracker.</a></p>

<p>(but other kinds of bug reports and/or feature requests
    are also always welcome, of course!)</p>
