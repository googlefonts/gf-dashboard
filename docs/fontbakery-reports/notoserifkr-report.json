Fonts built\n        with a hand-coded STAT table in feature syntax may be built either as static\n        or variable, but will end up with the same STAT table.\n\n        This is a problem, because a STAT table which works on variable fonts\n        will not be appropriate for static instances. The examples in the OpenType spec\n        of non-variable fonts with a STAT table show that the table entries must be\n        restricted to those entries which refer to the static font's position in\n        the designspace. i.e. a Regular weight static should only have the following\n        entry for the weight axis:\n\n        <AxisIndex value=\"0\"/>\n        <Flags value=\"2\"/>  <!-- ElidableAxisValueName -->\n        <ValueNameID value=\"265\"/>  <!-- Regular -->\n        <Value value=\"400.0\"/>\n\n        However, if the STAT table intended for a variable font is compiled into a\n        static, it will have many entries for this axis. In this case, Windows will\n        read the first entry only, causing all instances to report themselves\n        as \"Thin Condensed\".\n    ", "result": "SKIP", "severity": null}, {"description": "Check correctness of STAT table strings", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "NotoSerifKR[wght].ttf", "key": ["<Section: Universal Profile Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/STAT_strings>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": null, "message": "Looks good!"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "universal.stat", "proposal": ["https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/2863"], "rationale": "\n        On the STAT table, the \"Italic\" keyword must not be used on AxisValues\n        for variation axes other than 'ital'.\n    ", "result": "PASS", "severity": null}, {"description": "Check tabular widths don't have kerning.", "documentation": null, "experimental": "Since 2024/Jun/04", "filename": "NotoSerifKR[wght].ttf", "key": ["<Section: Universal Profile Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/tabular_kerning>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": null, "message": "Font has no tabular numerals"}, "status": "SKIP"}], "module": "universal", "proposal": ["https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/4440"], "rationale": "\n        Tabular glyphs should not have kerning, as they are meant to be used in tables.\n\n        This check looks for kerning in:\n        - all glyphs in a font in combination with tabular numerals;\n        - tabular symbols in combination with tabular numerals.\n\n        \"Tabular symbols\" is defined as:\n        - for fonts with a \"tnum\" feature, all \"tnum\" substitution target glyphs;\n        - for fonts without a \"tnum\" feature, all glyphs that have the same width\n        as the tabular numerals, but limited to numbers, math and currency symbols.\n\n        This check may produce false positives for fonts with no \"tnum\" feature\n        and with equal-width numerals (and other same-width symbols) that are\n        not intended to be used as tabular numerals.\n    ", "result": "SKIP", "severity": null}, {"description": "Ensure component transforms do not perform scaling or rotation.", "documentation": null, "experimental": false, "filename": "NotoSerifKR[wght].ttf", "key": ["<Section: Universal Profile Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.google.fonts/check/transformed_components>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": null, "message": "No glyphs had components with scaling or rotation"}, "status": "PASS"}], "module": "universal", "proposal": ["https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/2011"], "rationale": "\n        Some families have glyphs which have been constructed by using\n        transformed components e.g the 'u' being constructed from a flipped 'n'.\n\n        From a designers point of view, this sounds like a win (less work).\n        However, such approaches can lead to rasterization issues, such as\n        having the 'u' not sitting on the baseline at certain sizes after\n        running the font through ttfautohint.\n\n        Other issues are outlines that end up reversed when only one dimension\n        is flipped while the other isn't.\n\n        As of July 2019, Marc Foley observed that ttfautohint assigns cvt values\n        to transformed glyphs as if they are not transformed and the result is\n        they render very badly, and that vttLib does not support flipped components.\n\n        When building the font with fontmake, the problem can be fixed by adding\n        this to the command line:\n\n        --filter DecomposeTransformedComponentsFilter\n    ", "result": "PASS", "severity": null}, {"description": "Checking that the typoAscender exceeds the yMax of the /Agrave.", "documentation": null, "experimental": "Since 2024/Jul/17", "filename": "NotoSerifKR[wght].ttf", "key": ["<Section: Universal Profile Checks>", "<FontBakeryCheck:com.arrowtype.fonts/check/typoascender_exceeds_Agrave>", [["font", 0]]], "logs": [{"message": {"code": "typoAscender", "message": "OS/2.sTypoAscender value should be greater than 932, but got 880 instead"}, "status": "FAIL"}], "module": "universal.metrics", "proposal": ["https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues/3170"], "rationale": "\n        MacOS uses OS/2.sTypoAscender/Descender values to determine the line height\n        of a font.

Microsoft added it to OT with\n        just two DataMap records:\n\n        - dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts,\n          or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for.\n\n        - slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts,\n          or languages and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports.\n\n\n        The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the\n        font overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also\n        contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports\n        Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also\n        supports the Latn script.\n\n        The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,\n        but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly \"leading\" in the design,\n        while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a\n        Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it\u2019s designed\n        for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers\n        don\u2019t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.\n\n        The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language\n        and script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the\n        locl feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in\n        dlng explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages\n        in meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).\n\n        This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the\n        slng and dlng structures.\n\n        All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the 'meta' table.\n        Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to.\n        The Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for\n        smarter filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added\n        to the Noto fonts.\n\n        In the font making process, some environments store this data in external\n        files already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this\n        inside the font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools\n        may read this data.
