<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following loglevels were omitted in this report: SKIP, INFO, PASS, DEBUG</p>

    <p>Meaning of check results:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>💥 An <em>ERROR</em> is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
    <li>🔥 A <em>FAIL</em> is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
    <li>⚠️ A <em>WARN</em> is something that you should consider addressing.
    <li>ℹ️ An <em>INFO</em> result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
    <li>✅ A <em>PASS</em> means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
    <li>⏩ And a <em>SKIP</em> happens when the check does not apply to the given font.
    </ul>

    <p>If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at our
        <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues">issue tracker.</a></p>
