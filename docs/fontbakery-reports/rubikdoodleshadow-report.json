For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also\n        contains Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports\n        Hant, the Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also\n        supports the Latn script.\n\n        The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,\n        but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly \"leading\" in the design,\n        while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a\n        Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it\u2019s designed\n        for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers\n        don\u2019t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.\n\n        The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language\n        and script.
