<p>Meaning of check results:</p>

<ul>
<li>💥 An <em>ERROR</em> is something wrong with FontBakery itself, possibly a bug.
<li>☠ A <em>FATAL</em> is an extremely severe issue that must be addressed
immediately.
<li>🔥 A <em>FAIL</em> is a problem with the font that must be fixed.
<li>⚠️ A <em>WARN</em> is something that you should consider addressing.
<li>ℹ️ An <em>INFO</em> result simply prints something useful. Typically stats.
<li>✅ A <em>PASS</em> means the font looks good for the given checking routine.
<li>⏩ And a <em>SKIP</em> happens when the check does not apply to the given font.
</ul>

<p>If you get ERRORs, please help us improve the tool by reporting them at our
    <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery/issues">issue tracker.</a></p>

<p>(but other kinds of bug reports and/or feature requests
    are also always welcome, of course!)</p>
